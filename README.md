# CODSOFT_2

Overview:
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal.

Features:
Two-player gameplay
Interactive command-line interface
Basic game logic with win detection
Simple and intuitive user interface

Gameplay Instructions:
The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid with numbered spaces. Players will input their moves by entering the number corresponding to the space they want to mark.
The first player will use "X" as their symbol, and the second player will use "O".
To win the game, a player must get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Customization:
You can customize the game by modifying the TicTacToe class in the tic_tac_toe.py file. You can change the symbols used for players, modify the win condition logic, or add additional features as needed.
